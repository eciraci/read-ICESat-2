### ICESat-2 Data Products

| Product | Name | Description |  
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |    
| **ATL00** | Telemetry Data | Raw ATLAS telemetry in packet format|   
| **ATL01** | Reformatted Telemetry | Parsed, partially reformatted into HDF5, generated daily, segmented into several minute granules|   
| **ATL02** | Science Unit Converted Telemetry | Photon time of flight, corrected for instrument effects. Includes all photons, pointing data, spacecraft position, housekeeping data, engineering data, and raw atmospheric profiles, segmented into several minute granules.|   
| **ATL03** | Global Geolocated Photon Data | Precise latitude, longitude and elevation for every received photon, arranged by beam in the along-track direction. Photons classified by signal vs. background, as well as by surface type (land ice, sea ice, land, ocean), including all geophysical corrections. Segmented into several minute granules.|   
| **ATL04** | Uncalibrated Backscatter Profiles | Along-track atmospheric backscatter data, 25 times per second. Includes calibration coefficients for polar regions. Segmented into several minute granules.|

| **ATL21** | Arctic/Antarctic Gridded Sea Surface Height w/in Sea Ice | Gridded monthly sea surface height inside the sea ice cover.|     

### ICESat-2 Granules
Each orbit of ICESat-2 data is broken up into 14 granules.  The granule boundaries limit the size of each ATL03 file and simplify the formation of higher level data products.

### nsidc\_icesat2\_sync.py

-   Syncs all available ICESat-2 data for a specified data product, release, granule and track.  
-   The first time we run the script, it will copy the necessary dataset in the selected local directory.  
-   If we already have all the data, and we run the script again: only files added or modified on the remote server will downloaded.  

```bash
python nsidc_icesat2_sync.py --user=<username> --directory=<outgoing> \
	--release=001 --granule=10,11,12 --mode=0o775 ATL06
```
`-U X`, `--user=X`: username for NASA Earthdata Login  
`-D X`, `--directory`: local working directory for receiving data  
`--release=X`: ICESat-2 data release to sync  
`--version=X`: ICESat-2 data version to sync  
`--track=X`: ICESat-2 reference ground tracks to sync  
`--granule=X`: ICESat-2 granule regions to sync  
`--auxiliary`: Sync ICESat-2 auxiliary files for each HDF5 file  
`-M X`, `--mode=X`: Local permissions mode of the directories and files synced  
`--log`: output log of files downloaded  
`--list`: print files to be transferred, but do not execute transfer  
`-C`, `--clobber`: Overwrite existing data in transfer  

Also look into using the NSIDC subsetting API
